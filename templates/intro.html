        <h2>About the App</h2>
        <p>
            The Maize Crop Disease Classifier is an innovative tool designed to assist farmers and agricultural
            professionals in identifying and managing common maize diseases. By uploading a picture of a maize leaf, the
            app can accurately classify the condition into one of four categories: <b>Blight</b>, <b>Gray Leaf Spot</b>,
            <b>Common Rust</b>, or <b>Healthy</b>. In addition to classification, the app provides users with a
            treatment recommendation tailored to the identified disease.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond disease diagnosis, the app offers a comprehensive suite of features aimed at improving the farming
            experience:
        <ul>
            <li>Weather forecasts to help farmers plan their crop management activities.</li>
            <li>Recent activity logs for tracking past disease classifications and treatments.</li>
            <li>Analytics tools to monitor farm health and productivity over time.</li>
            <li>A community forum where users can exchange ideas, tips, and experiences.</li>
            <li>Latest agricultural news and learning resources to keep users informed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why We Created It</h2>
        <p>
            Agriculture plays a crucial role in ensuring food security, and maize is a staple crop in many regions.
            However, farmers face significant challenges in managing maize diseases that can lead to reduced crop
            yields. We created this app to empower both farmers and agricultural extension workers by providing a
            simple, accessible solution for diagnosing and treating maize diseases.
        </p>
        <p>
            The app is designed with two key users in mind: <b>Angel</b>, the farmer, and <b>Lonwabo</b>, the
            agricultural extension worker. For Angel, the app offers a quick and easy way to diagnose problems on the
            farm, with instant treatment recommendations that help improve crop health and prevent future losses. For
            Lonwabo, the app serves as a valuable tool to assist farmers with expert knowledge, providing real-time
            support through learning resources and data-driven insights.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal is to bridge the gap between technology and traditional farming practices, fostering healthier
            crops and more productive farms, ultimately contributing to food security.

        <h2>Who Can Use This App?</h2>
        <div class="persona">
            <h3>Farmers</h3>
            <h6>Angel (Age: 35)</h6>
            <p><strong>Background:</strong> Angel has been farming maize for over 10 years and runs a small family farm.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Struggles:</strong> She often struggles with identifying diseases in her crops due to lack of
                training and resources.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> With the app, she can easily take a picture of her maize plants and get an
                instant diagnosis. The app’s treatment recommendations help Angel manage the health of her crops,
                resulting in better yields and reduced crop losses.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="persona">
            <h3>Agricultural Extension Workers</h3>
            <h6>Lonwabo (Age: 29)</h6>
            <p><strong>Background:</strong> Lonwabo has a degree in agricultural science and works with local farmers to
                improve their crop health.</p>
            <p><strong>Struggles:</strong> He faces challenges in providing timely and accurate disease diagnoses due to
                the limited availability of diagnostic tools.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> The app helps him provide fast, accurate disease diagnoses and suggests
                treatments that are backed by data. Lonwabo can also share educational resources to help farmers
                understand disease prevention strategies.</p>
